Framework apps
==============

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this repo is to figure what we actually need the Framework to do.

Code
----

Clean reusable micro-applications should be located in apps directory, and the creepy stuff (framework) that ties it all together is in config.php.

Requirement
-----------

The creepy stuff needs to be refactored, this can be a requirement for the Framework component.

The objective of this project is to figure a correct way to develop reusable micro applications. 

Micro applications
------------------

Micro appplications are decoupled project components which are useless by themselves alone, but should solve a variety of needs when tied in together.

It is useful in a website production context, not only by encouraging agile practices but also by spreading maintenance of applications amongst users.

Applications
------------

The (basic, unfinished) example applications are:

Sites
    Help developing multisite projects.

Pages
    Help developing database driven static pages. Currently depends on Sites, which could be decoupled in a PagesSitesTiein.

Admin
    Crud for PersistentObject.

Dev
    Help development, so far it has scripts to manage the autoloader.

More development of these apps is not really required for the moment, getting them to play well together is the requirement to solve, IMHO.

Todo
----

The priority is to refactor the creepy config.php, which was made to study what should be refactored.

Most wanted: infamny
--------------------

The ugliest parts of the yet creepy config files are:

- poor application repository management,
- need to subclass ezcMvcResult for each app, to let the view recognize where it comes from and select zones accordinately.
